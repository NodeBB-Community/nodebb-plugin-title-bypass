# Title Bypass Plugin for NodeBB

This plugin bypasses the title check for creating new topics.
If you don't specify a title, or specify one that is too short, then a portion of the main post body will be set as the title.

That's it.

## Configuration

You cannot configure this plugin. To turn this functionality off, disable the plugin.
